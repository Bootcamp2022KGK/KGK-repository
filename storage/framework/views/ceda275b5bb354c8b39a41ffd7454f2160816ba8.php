        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>KGK Wheels, founded in 1996, originally supplied alloy wheels directly to the trade, however in 1998
            was launched and the game changed forever.
            From our small humble beginnings back then we have since grown with the industry and helped to lead it to
            where it is today.
            In the beginning, we imported alloy wheels from all over Europe and sold them here in the UK and Latvia,
            these days we are importing wheels from every corner of the planet and selling them in the opposite corner.
            Until recently we were able to claim that we carry the UK and Latvias largest range of alloy wheels,
            however, that has changed we now know we actually offer Europe's largest range of alloy wheels and tyres!
            With the latest version of our website, we have not only grown the number of alloy wheel and tyres brands
            but we have also started to open up into supplying suspension, more accessories, tuning equipment, brake
            upgrades and so much more.
            Here at KGK Wheels we don't want to stand still, we want to make sure we are always offering you the
            biggest range of Performance upgrades for your car, van, 4x4 or SUV in a nice, clean and efficient manner to
            make sure you, the customer, is always kept happy.
